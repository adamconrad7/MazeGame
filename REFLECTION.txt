  I found this project to be moderately difficult in comparison to the other programs this term. I liked that it required us to use most if not all of 
the concepts that we learned over the course of the term. Something that I would've done differently is made a better plan for the program, because I
didn't really grasp the full scope of the project until I was decently far along in my development. A major challenge that this program posed was debugging-
I had a segfault that was only triggered when approaching the instructor, so it took me an extremely long time playing through the entire maze over and over
to deduce the issue. The only major bug I had was this segfault, and it required me to advance my knowledge on using copy constructors on polymorphic objects.
I would say that stack overflow was an imperative resource for me on this assignment, as I have over fifteen tabs open as I'm writing this.
